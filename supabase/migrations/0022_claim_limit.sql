-- Backlog #16: cap the number of empty territories a player may be
-- actively claiming (peaceful occupation in progress, not yet completed:
-- claim_locked_by = caller and owner_id is still null) at once, at 5,
-- independent of the existing 32-territory ownership cap.
--
-- IMPORTANT: the app's actual empty-territory-claim path is
-- `declare_attack` -> (troops travel) -> `resolve_due_movements()`'s
-- "target is empty and unclaimed and has no NPC garrison" branch, which
-- converts the arrival into a claim (sets claim_locked_by). The standalone
-- `start_claim` RPC is not called anywhere in the current UI (dead/legacy
-- code path) but is still patched here too for consistency, in case it's
-- ever wired up.
--
-- The cap is enforced at `declare_attack` time (like the existing 32-cap
-- check), only when the target is *currently* known to be empty/unclaimed
-- with no NPC garrison -- i.e. exactly the condition that will make
-- resolve_due_movements() convert this into a claim on arrival. This
-- mirrors the existing pre-lock/post-lock double-check pattern already
-- used for every other invariant in this function. It is NOT re-verified
-- inside resolve_due_movements() at arrival time -- that function processes
-- one big batch of movements for every player in a single transaction, so
-- raising there would abort other players' unrelated resolutions too; the
-- declare-time check is the same trade-off already accepted for the
-- 32-territory ownership cap in this codebase.
--
-- Both functions redefined verbatim from 0020_speed_attribute.sql except
-- for the new active-claim-count check.
